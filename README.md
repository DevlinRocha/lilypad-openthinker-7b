# Getting Started with Create Lilypad Module

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Lilypad Module](https://github.com/DevlinRocha/create-lilypad-module).

## Prerequisites

To build and run a module on Lilypad Network, you'll need to have the [Lilypad CLI](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/lilypad-testnet/install-run-requirements) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine, as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) accounts.

## Getting Started

1. In your terminal, run `scripts/configure` and configure your module.
2. In your terminal, run `scripts/build` and wait for the Docker image to be built and pushed to Docker Hub.
3. Update "Image" field in [`lilypad_module.json.tmpl`](lilypad_module.json.tmpl).
4. Create a new GitHub repository, then commit and push your changes.

Your module's ready! ðŸŽ‰

Once your Docker image has been pushed to Docker Hub, you can run your module on Lilypad Network:

> Run `git log` in your terminal to easily find the latest commit hash to use as the GitHub tag.

```sh
export WEB3_PRIVATE_KEY=WEB3_PRIVATE_KEY

lilypad run github.com/github_username/module_repo:github_tag -i prompt="What animal order do frogs belong to"
```
